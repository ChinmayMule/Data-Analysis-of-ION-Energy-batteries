# Data-Analysis-of-ION-Energy-batteries

This is an assignment provided by ION Energy to analyse the given dataset and find the corelation between given two columns visually.
Corelations between the following pairs of values has been done :

1. Pair 1 between Grid Status and SoC.
2. Pair 2 between Equivalent cycles and SoH.
3. Pair 3 between SoC and Temperatre.

SoH - State of health
SoC = state of charge
